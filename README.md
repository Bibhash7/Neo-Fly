Created a **Django Rest Framework** based Flight Booking application that stores data on Neo4j graph database instead of an SQL database. Utilized **neomodel** ORM for successful interaction with the data model.

### Iteration 1 : Features:
- Supports basic CRUD operations on flights and passengers.
- Supports booking a flight and canceling a flight.
- Covered edge cases such as if a flight is already fully occupied.

### ETA:
- Establish Connection: 03-06-2024 ✅
- CRUD Operations: 05-06-2024 ✅
- Booking and Canceling: 06-06-2024 ✅
